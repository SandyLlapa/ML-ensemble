# ML-ensemble


Ensemble machine learning techniques combine multiple models to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability. Methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking work by aggregating the strengths of various models, reducing errors and improving generalization. These techniques are particularly useful when a single model might underperform, as the ensemble can make better, more balanced predictions by combining the outputs of different models.
